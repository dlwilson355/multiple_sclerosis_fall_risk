# multiple_sclerosis_fall_risk
A machine learning project for predicting the fall risk of patients with multiple sclerosis.

TODO:\
1.)  Stronger regularization.\
2.)  Fix patients missing data.\
3.)  Different loss function.\
4.)  Add columns of 0s to matrixDataGenerator.\
5.)  Use convolutional network as feature extractor to predict fall risk.\
6.)  Test UNet.\
7.)  Fiddle with parameters.\
8.)  Test VGG with batch normalization (https://gist.github.com/jjangsangy/38d644606130f05b806a4261c493a820). \
9.)  Find solution for redundant activities (concatenate them?).  Also ask Ryan about this.\
10.) Maybe improve rounding errors when finding indexes of interpolated timestamps.\
11.) Experiment with which activities to include in training.
