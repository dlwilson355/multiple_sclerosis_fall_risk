# multiple_sclerosis_fall_risk
A machine learning project for predicting the fall risk of patients with multiple sclerosis.

TODO: Daniel
Normalize data.
Use annotations.csv to get data from different activities for patients in a uniform manner.
Make data "shifted" such that it is wider than 56 by aligning later timestamps horizonally to create more suitable image dimensions.

TODO: Jost
Work on CNN.  Maybe RESNET 18? https://github.com/qubvel/classification_models
Work on dataGenerator.

TODO: Mark
Work on random forest.

Long term goal: Use CNN or RNN as feature extractor and predict fall risk based on those features.
